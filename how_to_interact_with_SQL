- SQL is a programming language that allow to communicate with a database.
    *Process:
                    - Write some SQL code, also known as, statements, code and queries, and you will get a respond from server's database.

    *Process from Browser:
        ** If you are in the browser and you want to know about Real Madrid first squad,
            when you click a button it create a request, the browser will go get the information you want as soon as possible.

            ***This is what is happening when you press the botton

                     1) Browser send a request, which is in SQL code
                     2) SQL code is send to the Server to talk to its Database
                     3) Server sends back the result from from the its database in SQL code
                     4) SQL code goes back to the Website with the information you requested.


- Lets do some SQL code.

    ** Our Dadabase is called Real-Madrid-DB
    ** Out table is called 'First_Squad'

    ** Here is the database table we are going to be working with

                    id                      player                          position                    number               <----Columns (Left to right)

            *** Intructions:
                                    1)Retrieve a list of all players with id, position and number
                                    2)Retrieve all the players players with their positions, ids and numbers
                                    3)Retrieve the player with the id 1

            *** These is the how to retrieve some data out of the database:
                    *** In SQL we use SELECT statement.

                                    **** SELECT _______   <- here we write the colums or colum we want to search
                                            FROM ________;  <- here we write the table where the data is in
                                                                           <- IMPORTANT- all SQL statements has to end with semicolon!!!!!!!!

            *** Now, let's look at the instructions above(in line number 35)
                    1) Let's start retrieving all the players writing SQL code/statements/queries

                            SELECT players                 <-Notice, only one column was selected, so this column will contain all data from all the rows. (from the column selected)
                            FROM First_Squad;

                            The the code/statement/querie above will return these values out from the database.

                                        player      <----Columns (Left to right)
                                     ___________
                                    I  C.Ronaldo   I         <-- rows (Top- bottom)
                                    I------------------I
                                    I  Navas          I
                                    I------------------I
                                    I   Bale            I
                                    I___________I

                            Since we did not specified what player we wanted the database gave us all the players.

            *** Now, lets look at the instruction number 2, located above. (in line number 36)

                    2) Let's retrieve a list of the players with their positions, ids and numbers, writing the following query:

                             SELECT player, position     <-- WOW! we can select multipe columns!
                             FROM First_Squad;

                    **** Since we can SELECT multiple colums, lets do this querie instead:

                            SELECT id, player, position, number
                            FROM First_Squad;

                            The query above will return all of the data inside the database

                            What if we have 10000 Columns, or even 20? We don't want to type all of them to make a query, right?. So lets do the following:

                    **** By writing

                                SELECT *           <-- The ' asterisk ' will select all the columns.
                                FROM movies;

                            Basically, the query above is the same as the query we typed above of the query above, but with less typing.

            *** What if we want to just have an specific data from the data base?
                    **** We can use WHERE clause to filter out data, and find specific requested data.

                                SELECT_____
                                FROM_______
                                WHERE______;   <-- Whatever we write here the query will go to the database to look for it. If it matches, it will return it to us


            *** Now, let's look at the instructions 3 located above( in line number 37)
                        1) Let's retrieve the player with the id 1

                                SELECT player
                                FROM First_Squad
                                Where id = 1;

                                The query above  will look at the column ' player ', it will select all rows in the ' player ' column.
                                Than, it will look at the column ' id ' and look for number 3. IMPORTANT: The query we typed will keep searching until it goes through all the rows of the column ' id ' to make sure there is no other number 3

                                Finally after it find a match, the database will return

                                    C.Ronaldo

            *** Let's do one more query.
                        **** Turns out that WHERE clause can return a ' string ' of data too.

                            SELECT *
                            FROM First_Squad
                            WHERE player = 'C.Ronaldo';  <-- Single Quotations are used around string values and selects all string characters values.
